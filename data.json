The galaxy enters a new era as the fearless soldiers of the Coding Alliance won a decisive battle against the Omicron empire.\n\nWhile the whole quadrant celebrates a world coming back to normal, another threat dating from the ancient times of the freezing Code War, shakes the galaxy once again, bringing its lot of fire and tears.\n\nThe Alliance finest, Captain Bundle and Admiral Seaborn are now in search of a new hope to bring peace to the galaxy.\n\nLuckily for them, a new generation of young apprentices have been secretly, sometimes remotely, training in the holy scripts of Ruby and Python.\n\nIn their attempt to consolidate freedom and build new futures for the world and themselves, they have been creating 15 sacred digital weapons and prepare themselves for the last battle...\n\nThe big day is about to start, the coding galaxy is about to change, forever."
